This file contains information about all of the different enemy types in the game.

For reference, I will include what the various attributes mean.
For ability descriptions, consult the file specifically for that. 
I didn't include a "universal" player information because that will differ depending on how they build their character
Instead, I included a sample level one character.
Note that as the game progresses, the character will level up and become more powerful (as will the enemies)
Thus the information presented is for the first level unless there is a special case.
